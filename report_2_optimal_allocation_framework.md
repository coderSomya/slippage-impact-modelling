# Report 2: Mathematical Framework for Optimal Order Allocation

## Executive Summary

This report presents a rigorous mathematical framework for optimal order allocation that minimizes total temporary market impact when executing a large order of S shares over N=390 trading periods. We formulate the problem as a constrained optimization problem and develop both offline and real-time algorithmic solutions based on our power law impact model.

## Problem Formulation

### Mathematical Setup

Given:
- **S**: Total shares to be purchased
- **N**: Number of trading periods (N=390 for one-minute intervals)
- **g_t(x)**: Temporary impact function at time t for order size x
- **x_i**: Allocation in period i (decision variables)

**Objective**: Minimize total temporary impact
**Constraint**: Sum of allocations must equal total shares

### Optimization Problem

```
minimize: Σᵢ₌₁ᴺ g_tᵢ(xᵢ)
subject to: Σᵢ₌₁ᴺ xᵢ = S
           xᵢ ≥ 0 for all i ∈ {1, 2, ..., N}
```

Where:
- `g_tᵢ(xᵢ)` is the temporary impact function at time t_i
- `xᵢ` is the allocation in period i
- `S` is the total shares to be purchased

## Impact Function Specification

### Power Law Model

Based on our empirical analysis, we use the power law impact model:

```
g_t(x) = γ_t * x^p
```

Where:
- `γ_t`: Time-varying impact coefficient
- `p`: Stock-specific power law exponent (0.3-0.7)
- `x`: Order size

### Time-Varying Coefficients

The impact coefficient `γ_t` varies throughout the trading day:

```
γ_t = γ_base * (1 + α₁ * f₁(t) + α₂ * f₂(t) + α₃ * f₃(t))
```

Where:
- `γ_base`: Base impact coefficient
- `f₁(t)`: Intraday pattern function
- `f₂(t)`: Volatility regime function  
- `f₃(t)`: Market microstructure function

## Solution Methods

### Method 1: Dynamic Programming (Offline)

For the offline optimization problem, we use dynamic programming:

**State Space**: `(t, remaining_shares)`
**Value Function**: `V(t, s) = minimum total impact from period t onwards with s shares remaining`

**Recursion**:
```
V(t, s) = min_{x_t} [g_t(x_t) + V(t+1, s-x_t)]
```

**Boundary Conditions**:
```
V(N+1, s) = 0 if s = 0, ∞ otherwise
V(t, 0) = 0 for all t
```

**Algorithm**:
```python
def dynamic_programming_optimize(S, N, impact_functions):
    # Initialize value function
    V = np.full((N+1, S+1), np.inf)
    V[N+1, 0] = 0
    
    # Backward induction
    for t in range(N, 0, -1):
        for s in range(S+1):
            for x in range(s+1):
                impact = impact_functions[t-1](x)
                V[t, s] = min(V[t, s], impact + V[t+1, s-x])
    
    # Forward pass to recover optimal allocation
    allocation = []
    remaining = S
    for t in range(1, N+1):
        for x in range(remaining+1):
            if abs(V[t, remaining] - impact_functions[t-1](x) - V[t+1, remaining-x]) < 1e-10:
                allocation.append(x)
                remaining -= x
                break
    
    return allocation
```

### Method 2: Constrained Optimization (Real-time)

For real-time implementation, we use sequential quadratic programming:

**Objective Function**:
```
f(x) = Σᵢ₌₁ᴺ γᵢ * xᵢ^p
```

**Constraints**:
```
Σᵢ₌₁ᴺ xᵢ = S
xᵢ ≥ 0 for all i
```

**Algorithm**:
```python
def constrained_optimization_allocate(S, N, impact_params):
    def objective(x):
        total_impact = 0
        for i in range(N):
            total_impact += impact_params[i]['gamma'] * (x[i] ** impact_params[i]['p'])
        return total_impact
    
    def constraint(x):
        return np.sum(x) - S
    
    # Initial guess: TWAP allocation
    x0 = np.ones(N) * (S / N)
    
    # Bounds: non-negative allocations
    bounds = [(0, None)] * N
    
    # Constraints
    constraints = [{'type': 'eq', 'fun': constraint}]
    
    # Optimization
    result = minimize(objective, x0, method='SLSQP', 
                     bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)
    
    return result.x
```

## Advanced Framework: Multi-Period Optimization

### Adaptive Allocation Strategy

For enhanced performance, we implement an adaptive strategy that updates allocations based on market conditions:

**Multi-Period Objective**:
```
minimize: Σᵢ₌₁ᴺ [γᵢ * xᵢ^p + λ * (xᵢ - x_{i-1})²]
```

Where:
- First term: Temporary impact
- Second term: Smoothing penalty (prevents excessive order size changes)
- `λ`: Smoothing parameter

**Real-time Updates**:
```python
def adaptive_allocation(current_time, remaining_shares, market_conditions):
    # Update impact parameters based on current market conditions
    updated_params = estimate_impact_params(market_conditions)
    
    # Re-optimize remaining allocation
    remaining_periods = N - current_time
    allocation = constrained_optimization_allocate(
        remaining_shares, remaining_periods, updated_params
    )
    
    return allocation
```

## Market Microstructure Integration

### Enhanced Impact Model

We extend our framework to incorporate market microstructure factors:

```
g_t(x) = γ_t * x^p * (1 + α₁ * spread_t + α₂ * depth_t + α₃ * imbalance_t)
```

**Market Condition Functions**:
- `spread_t`: Normalized bid-ask spread
- `depth_t`: Order book depth factor
- `imbalance_t`: Bid-ask imbalance ratio

### Real-time Parameter Estimation

```python
def estimate_market_conditions(order_book_data):
    spread_factor = order_book_data['spread_bps'] / 100
    depth_factor = 1000 / order_book_data['total_depth']
    imbalance_factor = abs(order_book_data['bid_ask_imbalance'])
    
    return {
        'spread_factor': spread_factor,
        'depth_factor': depth_factor,
        'imbalance_factor': imbalance_factor
    }
```

## Implementation Algorithm

    def __init__(self, total_shares, num_periods=390):
        self.total_shares = total_shares
        self.num_periods = num_periods
        self.allocated_shares = 0
        self.remaining_shares = total_shares
        
    def get_allocation(self, current_period, market_conditions):
        """
        Get optimal allocation for current period
        """
        # Estimate impact parameters
        impact_params = self.estimate_impact_params(market_conditions)
        
        # Calculate remaining periods
        remaining_periods = self.num_periods - current_period
        
        # Optimize remaining allocation
        allocation = self.optimize_remaining_allocation(
            self.remaining_shares, remaining_periods, impact_params
        )
        
        # Return allocation for current period
        return allocation[0]
    
    def optimize_remaining_allocation(self, shares, periods, impact_params):
        """
        Optimize allocation for remaining periods
        """
        def objective(x):
            total_impact = 0
            for i in range(periods):
                total_impact += impact_params[i]['gamma'] * (x[i] ** impact_params[i]['p'])
            return total_impact
        
        def constraint(x):
            return np.sum(x) - shares
        
        # Initial guess: equal allocation
        x0 = np.ones(periods) * (shares / periods)
        
        # Bounds and constraints
        bounds = [(0, None)] * periods
        constraints = [{'type': 'eq', 'fun': constraint}]
        
        # Optimization
        result = minimize(objective, x0, method='SLSQP',
                         bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)
        
        return result.x
    
    def update_allocation(self, executed_shares):
        """
        Update remaining shares after execution
        """
        self.allocated_shares += executed_shares
        self.remaining_shares -= executed_shares
```

## Performance Analysis

## Risk Management

### Implementation Risk

**Slippage Risk**: Actual impact may differ from predicted
**Market Risk**: Market conditions may change unexpectedly
**Execution Risk**: Orders may not execute at expected prices

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Conservative Parameter Estimation**: Use upper bounds for impact parameters
2. **Smoothing Constraints**: Limit order size changes between periods
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitor execution quality
4. **Fallback Strategies**: Implement TWAP as backup

### Risk-Adjusted Objective

```
minimize: Σᵢ₌₁ᴺ [γᵢ * xᵢ^p + λ₁ * (xᵢ - x_{i-1})² + λ₂ * xᵢ²]
```

Where:
- First term: Temporary impact
- Second term: Smoothing penalty
- Third term: Risk penalty (prevents large allocations)

## Practical Considerations

### Computational Efficiency

**Offline Optimization**: O(N × S²) complexity
**Real-time Optimization**: O(N³) per update
**Approximate Methods**: Use heuristics for large-scale problems

### Market Impact Considerations

**Information Leakage**: Large orders may signal intentions
**Market Resilience**: Impact may decay over time
**Cross-Impact**: Orders in one period affect subsequent periods

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with smaller allocations
2. **Monitor Execution**: Track actual vs predicted impact
3. **Adapt Parameters**: Update impact estimates based on execution
4. **Maintain Flexibility**: Allow for strategy adjustments
